              Internal data
            </h3>
            <p class="text-body font-primary text-main leading-relaxed mb-6">
              We reviewed the existing user flow using available behavioral metrics and internal data. While limited, the data showed a significant drop-off between CTA interaction and purchase.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body font-primary text-main leading-relaxed mb-6">
              From a monetisation perspective, this suggested a mismatch between user intent and perceived value as users were engaging but not committing. From a UX standpoint I identified another interaction issue: by presenting the paywall as a first step, users were likely tapping "continue" without fully processing the information, only to drop off once they reached the main experience. This also highlighted a risk of false engagement metrics, where CTA interaction did not reflect genuine intent.
            </p>
            <p class="text-body font-primary text-main leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This interpretation shifted the direction of the experiment away from optimising the paywall itself and toward improving value comprehension earlier in the journey, before asking users to make a decision.

              Competitive Analysis
            </h3>
            <p class="text-body font-primary text-main leading-relaxed mb-6">
              We analysed four competitors in the productivity app space, focusing on document management tools. Across these products, onboarding played a central role in setting expectations, with features introduced progressively through short flows, interactive demos, and paywalls positioned after users had experienced initial value.

            <li>The first-time user experience should prioritise product value communication over immediate monetisation.</li>
            <li>Early interactions should help users understand what the product enables, before asking for commitment.</li>

            Key Design Decisions
          </h2>
          <p class="text-body font-primary text-main leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The design decisions focused on addressing a specific problem identified during research: we were asking users to commit without properly guiding them on the benefits of subscribing. To resolve this, each step of the onboarding was intentionally designed to build understanding, reduce false engagement, and prepare users to make an informed decision at the paywall.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-h3 font-primary font-bold mb-4 text-main">
            Decision 1: Use progressive disclosure
          </h3>
          <p class="text-body font-primary text-main leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Each section of the onboarding is introduced individually with limited copy and a single visual focus. This was intentional to prevent overwhelming first-time users while still building a clear mental model of the product's value.

          </h3>
          <p class="text-body font-primary text-main leading-relaxed mb-8">
            We focused on three core paid features, <i>editing</i>, <i>signing</i>, and <i>text extraction</i>. These were selected based on user reviews, monetisation insights, and competitor analysis, ensuring users understood exactly what they would be paying for before encountering the paywall.

          </h3>
          <p class="text-body font-primary text-main leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Research showed that users were interacting with the CTA without fully processing information, leading to drop-off and misleading engagement metrics. By delaying the paywall until after users had seen core features, we reframed monetisation as a confirmation step rather than a barrier.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body font-primary text-main leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The paywall highlights the key value points in a minimalistic design with title plus five bullet points, aligned with insights from previous experiments that showed simpler paywalls outperform more elaborate versions.

            The onboarding flow also needed to accommodate existing marketing requirements, including notification prompts, which influenced both its structure and length.
