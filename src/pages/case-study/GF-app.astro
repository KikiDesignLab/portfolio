                        Find Me Gluten Free helps users find gluten-free restaurants based on community reviews. However, its current home experience feels overwhelming, with competing CTAs, inconsistent iconography, and no clear learning path for new users.

                        I started by mapping the main user journey from home page to restaurant details focusing on how users could filter by safety (Dedicated gluten-free and Most Celiac Friendly) and read reviews for certified members.

                        The first wireframes clarified the navigation flow but the home page proved the most challenging as there was a lot to fit in, and it was still feeling crowded and unfocused.

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        In the second iteration, I restructured the experience around two primary filters <strong>Dedicated Gluten-Free</strong> and <strong>Most Celiac Friendly</strong>, and organized supporting content (Nearby, Latest Reviews, Browse by Category) into horizontally
                        scrollable sections for easier scanning.

                            This new hierarchy made better use of the screen space:

                            <li>Highlighting the two main safety filters as primary actions</li>
                            <li>Organizing supporting content into horizontally scrollable sections for faster scanning</li>
                            <li>Following familiar mobile patterns to make the experience feel natural and effortless</li>

                        Based on feedback from the usability tests, I also introduced a Gluten-Free Card, translatable into multiple languages, to help users safely communicate dietary needs abroad or across language barriers.

                        Designing for health conditions means designing for emotional safety, not just usability. Simplifying pages and sections proved more complex than expected. User stories were essential to stay focused on what truly matters. As Steve Krug says, <i>be ruthless in what you cut</i> (and it's harder than it sounds).
